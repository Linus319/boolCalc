#H1 Boolean Algebra Calculator / Truth Table Generator

My original inspiration was when I took a Digital Systems course, an plugging in Boolean Expressions to check my work wouldn't have been way more preferable if I could use a tool that evaluates a Boolean expression such as `ABC+F`, which would be the equivalent to `(A && B && C) || F`. All I've done so far is get my foot in the door with this project, but whther or not computer engineering students, electrical engineer, etc get any good use out of this that's a win in my book.

So far, I belive my app can handle Boolean Algebra syntax similar to what you would see in C++ or Java, but I'm working towards making it more flexible and human friend. And if you must know, I'm doing it so I don't have to type all those ampersands and pipes just to write out what is not much different from algebra (syntatically).

More updates coming !
